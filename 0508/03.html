    <p>Back when I was a child
        Before life removed all the innocence
        My father would lift me high
        And dance with my mother and me and then
        Spin me around till I fell asleep
        Then up the stairs he would carry me
        And I knew for sure I was loved
        If I could get another chance
        Another walk, another dance with him
        I'd play a song that would never ever end
        How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again, ooh
        When I and my mother would disagree
        To get my way I would run from her to him
        He'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah, yeah
        Then finally make me do just what my momma said
        Later that night when I was asleep
        He left a dollar under my sheet
        Never dreamed that he would be gone from me
        If I could steal one final glance, one final step
        One final dance with him
        I'd play a song that would never ever end
        'Cause I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again
        Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
        And I'd hear how my mother cried for him
        I pray for her even more than me
        I pray for her even more than me
        I know I'm praying for much too much
        But could you send back the only man she loved?
        I know you don't do it usually
        But dear Lord she's dying to dance with my father again
        Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream</p>
